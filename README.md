# Pneumonia-Detection-Computer-Vision

In this project machine learning models are built to detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images. Convolutional neural network based model was built using LeNet-5 CNN. Also, experimentations were done using data augmentation. Further, pre-trained VGG16 model was trained on the chest x-ray set contains a training set of 5,235 images.
